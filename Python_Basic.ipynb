        "1. What is Python and why is it popular ?\n",
        "   -  Python is a programming language.\n",
        "      It is popular due to\n",
        "      i)ease of learning\n",
        "      ii) versatile use in different fields like automation , machine learning , data science\n",
        "      iii)readability\n",
        "      iv)availability of large number of libraries\n",
        "      v) huge active community who writes codes and publish in Python for others to use.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - An interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python language line by line. It translates the code into machine readable bytecode and then executes this.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Keywords are some special words which are used for some specific purpose . some predefined keywords used in Python are : if , elif, else, print , type ,for, while , not , or , and True , False , continue , break , none.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, keywords can not be used as variable names.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - The property of editing the state or value of any object after creating once is called mutability in Python.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "   - “==” and “is” are two operators used in Python.\n",
        "     “==” is Comparison operator which compares two values and returns Boolean value.\n",
        "I    “is” is Identity operator which compares the memory location of two\n",
        "     objects.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "   - Logical operators combine multiple conditions to evaluate them as a single Boolean Expression. and , or , not are logical operators used in Python.\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "  - The process of changing the data type of a value or object is called type casting in Python.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "  - The difference between implicit and explicit type casting is in implicit type casting Python can automatically changes the data type without any intervention of user where in explicit type casting programmer manually converts one data type to another by calling the    \n",
        "  relevant function.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "  - Conditional statements are used to code decisions based on some preconditions.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "  - elif is a conditional statement which is used to code decisions based on multiple Precondiotions.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
        "   - “ for” loop iterate over a sequence of elements where a s”while” loop repeatedly executes a block until a condition is met.\n",
